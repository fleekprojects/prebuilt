PreBuilt Web App
###################

A custom-built platform is required where the customer can order a pre-built website, by selecting any of the pre-built themes displayed on the site and pays either one-time or monthly fee to have the website.



The website domain and hosting will be managed by the siteâ€™s admin. You can better understand the concept by checking out shopify.com. Customers just pay a monthly fee against, website design, domain, hosting and any other hosting maintenance related service.



Changes/updates on the website will be charged from the customer.

User Experience Flow
*********************

Main pages of the website will be designed later. We need to test and experience the user experience with the order flow of the application. 

-  `Customer visits the site and hit the get project started sequence.`
-  `Business details; business name, industry, upload logo (if any).`
-  `Enter domain name (if any), otherwise search for a domain name (Namecheap API to find & buy domain). Domain search results will appear on this step for selection.`
-  `Themes preview (Images) Clicking any image will zoom in for larger preview.`
-  `Requirements info; the customer will enter details about the project here. Just one field to gather all info.`
