PreBuilt Web App
###################

A custom-built platform is required where the customer can order a pre-built website, by selecting any of the pre-built themes displayed on the site and pays either one-time or monthly fee to have the website.



The website domain and hosting will be managed by the site’s admin. You can better understand the concept by checking out shopify.com. Customers just pay a monthly fee against, website design, domain, hosting and any other hosting maintenance related service.



Changes/updates on the website will be charged from the customer.
